This course is an introduction to arithmetic geometry, a subject that lies at the intersection of algebraic geometry and number theory. Its primary motivation is the study of classical [Diophantine problems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equation) from the modern perspective of algebraic geometry.
